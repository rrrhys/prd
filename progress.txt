- **Status**: dev done
- **Implementation**:
  - Created public/app.js with 330 lines of JavaScript
  - **API Integration**:
    - Implemented fetchAndDisplayTickets() to call GET /api/tickets on page load
    - Async/await pattern with proper error handling
    - Displays user-friendly error messages on API failures
  - **Ticket Display Logic**:
    - displayTickets() function groups tickets by status into 5 categories
    - Clears existing column content before rendering
    - Handles empty states with "No tickets" message
  - **Ticket Card Rendering**:
    - createTicketCard() generates card HTML for each ticket
    - Displays ticket ID with # prefix
    - Shows ticket title (XSS-safe with escapeHtml)
    - Priority badge with color-coded styling (priority-low/med/high classes)
    - Effort badge with 📊 emoji and story points
    - Assignee display with 👤 emoji
    - Cards marked as draggable (draggable=true) for future drag-and-drop
  - **Column Count Updates**:
    - updateColumnCounts() updates badge counts in column headers
    - Dynamically reflects number of tickets in each status
  - **Modal Management**:
    - openAddTicketModal() for creating new tickets
    - openEditTicketModal(ticket) for editing existing tickets
    - closeModal() with proper form reset
    - Modal overlay click-to-close functionality
    - ESC key support via close button
  - **Form Handling**:
    - handleFormSubmit() processes both create (POST) and update (PATCH) operations
    - Validates ticket ID to determine create vs edit mode
    - Sends JSON payload with proper Content-Type headers
    - Refreshes ticket display after successful save
    - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - **Event Listeners**:
    - "Add Ticket" button opens create modal
    - Ticket card click opens edit modal with pre-filled data
    - Form submit for save operation
    - Cancel button and close (×) button
    - Modal overlay click to dismiss
  - **Security & Best Practices**:
    - XSS prevention with escapeHtml() function
    - Proper error logging to console for debugging
    - Clean separation of concerns (fetch, display, render, events)
    - Modern JavaScript (async/await, arrow functions, template literals)
    - DOM element caching in initializeElements()
  - **Integration Ready**:
    - Works with existing HTML structure from Task 6
    - Uses CSS classes from Task 7 for styling
    - Calls backend API endpoints from Tasks 3-5
    - Prepared for drag-and-drop in Task 9 (draggable attribute set)
- **Files created**:
  - public/app.js
- **Committed**: 4fc60e9 "Implement JavaScript to fetch and display tickets (Task 8)"
- **Bug Fixes Applied** (2026-02-01):
  - Fixed modal display mechanism: Changed from `modal.classList.add/remove('active')` to `modal.style.display = 'flex'/'none'` to work with HTML inline styles
  - Fixed close button selector: Changed `querySelector('.close-btn')` to `getElementById('modal-close')` to match actual HTML element ID
  - Fixed modal overlay click handler: Updated to use `modal-overlay` element ID for proper click-to-close functionality
  - Fixed `updateColumnCounts()`: Changed from getElementById approach to `querySelectorAll('.column-count')` since HTML uses class names, not IDs for column count badges
  - All modal interactions now work correctly (open, close, overlay click)
  - Column count badges now update properly when tickets are displayed
- **Next**: Task 9 - Implement drag-and-drop functionality

#### Task 9: Implement drag-and-drop functionality ✓
- **Date**: 2026-02-01
- **Status**: dev done
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `setupDragAndDrop()` function called from `setupEventListeners()` to initialize drag-and-drop on all columns
  - **Drag Start Handler** (`handleDragStart()`):
    - Stores ticket ID in `dataTransfer` for retrieval on drop
    - Sets `effectAllowed` to 'move' for proper drag cursor
    - Adds 'dragging' CSS class to card for visual feedback (50% opacity from existing styles)
  - **Drag End Handler** (`handleDragEnd()`):
    - Removes 'dragging' class from card
    - Cleans up 'drag-over' classes from all columns
  - **Drag Over Handler** (`handleDragOver()`):
    - Prevents default to allow drop operation
    - Sets `dropEffect` to 'move'
  - **Drag Enter Handler** (`handleDragEnter()`):
    - Adds 'drag-over' CSS class to column when dragging over it
    - Uses conditional check to only apply to column-content elements
  - **Drag Leave Handler** (`handleDragLeave()`):
    - Removes 'drag-over' class when leaving column
    - Checks `relatedTarget` to avoid removing class when entering child elements
  - **Drop Handler** (`handleDrop()`):
    - Async function to handle the drop event
    - Retrieves ticket ID from `dataTransfer`
    - Gets new status from column's `data-status` attribute
    - Checks if status changed (no-op if dropped in same column)
    - **Optimistic UI update**: Immediately moves card to new column and updates counts
    - Calls `PATCH /api/tickets/:id` with new status
    - On success: Refreshes board with `fetchAndDisplayTickets()` for data consistency
    - On error: Rolls back UI by moving card back to original column and restoring counts
    - Displays error message to user via `showError()`
  - **Helper Function** (`updateColumnCountsFromDOM()`):
    - Counts actual ticket cards in DOM (excludes empty state messages)
    - Updates column header badges with current counts
    - Used during optimistic updates and rollbacks
  - **Event Listeners**:
    - Card listeners: `dragstart`, `dragend` (attached in `createTicketCard()`)
    - Column listeners: `dragover`, `dragenter`, `dragleave`, `drop` (attached in `setupDragAndDrop()`)
  - **Visual Feedback**:
    - Utilizes existing CSS classes from Task 7:
      - `.dragging` class: 50% opacity on dragged card
      - `.drag-over` class: dashed blue border on drop target column
    - Smooth transitions already implemented in styles.css
  - **Error Handling**:
    - Complete rollback of UI changes if API call fails
    - User-friendly error messages
    - Console error logging for debugging
  - **Performance**:
    - Optimistic UI updates provide instant feedback
    - No blocking operations during drag
    - Full data refresh ensures UI stays in sync with backend
- **Files modified**:
  - public/app.js (added ~150 lines for drag-and-drop functionality)
- **Bug Fix** (2026-02-01):
  - Added `data-status` attributes to all `.column-content` divs in public/index.html
  - This ensures `handleDrop()` can correctly retrieve the new status from `column.dataset.status`
  - Updated all 5 columns: backlog, marked for dev, in dev, dev done, uat done
- **Next**: All core features complete! Tasks 10-12 were already implemented earlier.

#### Task 13: Fix comments display on frontend UI ✓
- **Date**: 2026-02-01
- **Status**: dev done
- **Issue**: Comments from completed tasks were not visible in the frontend UI
- **Root Cause Analysis**:
  1. Existing comments were never displayed anywhere in the UI
  2. The comments textarea in the edit modal didn't send data to the API
  3. Backend PATCH endpoint would overwrite entire comments array instead of appending
- **Implementation**:
  - **Frontend HTML Changes** (public/index.html):
    - Added dedicated "Existing Comments" display section above the add comment field
    - Created `<div id="existing-comments">` container with class "comments-display"
    - Updated label for comments textarea to "Add New Comment" for clarity
  - **Frontend CSS Changes** (public/styles.css):
    - Added `.comments-display` styling: gray background, bordered, scrollable (max 200px)
    - Added `.comment-item` styling: white background, blue left border, proper spacing
    - Empty state shows "No comments yet" placeholder text
  - **Frontend JavaScript Changes** (public/app.js):
    - Created `displayExistingComments(comments)` function (lines 261-278)
    - Function renders each comment as a styled div element
    - Updated `openEditTicketModal()` to call `displayExistingComments()` (line 256)
    - Updated `closeModal()` to clear comments display (lines 293-297)
    - Modified `handleFormSubmit()` to send `newComment` field when editing (lines 319-322)
  - **Backend Changes** (server.js):
    - Updated PATCH endpoint to handle `newComment` separately (lines 217-229)
    - Backend now appends new comment to existing comments array
    - Uses destructuring to exclude `newComment` from spread operator: `const { newComment, ...updateData } = req.body`
    - Preserves all existing comments and adds new one to array
- **Impact**:
  - All existing task comments (tasks 1-12) are now visible when editing tickets
  - Users can see full comment history for each ticket
  - New comments are appended progressively without losing existing ones
  - Comments display is read-only (existing) + writable (new comment field)
- **Files modified**:
  - public/index.html (added comments display section)
  - public/styles.css (added comments styling)
  - public/app.js (display and submission logic)
  - server.js (append comment logic)
- **Committed**: b4bc96c "Fix comments display on frontend (Task 13)"
- **Additional Improvements** (commit ef71dc2):
  - Added `currentTicket` variable to properly track the ticket being edited
  - Enhanced `openAddTicketModal()` to clear currentTicket reference and comments display
  - Enhanced `openEditTicketModal()` to store currentTicket reference for better state management
  - Enhanced `closeModal()` to properly clean up currentTicket reference
  - Improved overall state management for comments functionality
- **Alignment Fix** (commit f575c99):

#### Task 15: Update PRD instructions for status monitoring ✓
- **Date**: 2026-02-01
- **Status**: dev done
- **Issue**: No way for user to monitor which task Claude is currently working on
- **Implementation**:
  - Updated .prd/readme.txt with new guideline for LLMs (guideline #7)
  - Added instruction: "When you start working on a ticket, immediately update its status to 'in dev'"
  - Requirement: Update status BEFORE beginning implementation work
  - Requirement: Add a comment noting when work started on the ticket
  - **Benefits**:
    - Users can monitor task progress in real-time

- **Files modified**:
  - .prd/prd.json (updated task 15 status to "dev done" and added comments)
- **Next**: Task 16 - Add config.json for project customization

#### Task 16: Add config.json for project customization ✓
- **Date**: 2026-02-01
- **Status**: dev done
- **Issue**: Need to configure project name and port for multiple instances
- **Implementation**:
  - Created .prd/config.json with default configuration:
    - projectName: "Work Manager" (customizable project name for tab title)
    - port: 3000 (configurable port for multiple running instances)
  - **Backend Changes** (server.js):
    - Added config loading logic at startup using fs.readFileSync
    - Reads config.json from .prd folder with error handling
    - Falls back to defaults if config file not found or invalid
    - Uses config.port for server PORT variable
    - Added GET /api/config endpoint to serve projectName to frontend
    - Endpoint only exposes projectName (not port for security)
  - **Frontend Changes** (public/app.js):
    - Created fetchConfigAndUpdateUI() async function
    - Fetches config from /api/config on page load
    - Updates document.title to "{projectName} - Kanban Board"
    - Updates header title (.header-title) to display projectName
    - Error handling with fallback to defaults if fetch fails
    - Called from DOMContentLoaded event before fetching tickets
  - **Documentation Updates** (.prd/setup_instructions.md):
    - Added config.json to file structure listing in Installation Steps section
    - Added new "Configuration File" section with:
      - Default config.json structure and field descriptions
      - Instructions for changing project name with example
      - Instructions for changing port with example
    - Updated "Running Multiple Instances" section:
      - Replaced manual server.js editing with config.json approach
      - Added examples showing three projects with different names and ports
    - Added GET /api/config to API Endpoints section with response example
    - Updated "Customization > Changing Project Name" to reference Configuration File section
  - **Benefits**:
    - Users can customize project name in browser tab and header
    - Multiple instances can run on different ports without code changes
    - Configuration centralized in single JSON file
    - Backend validates and provides safe defaults
    - Frontend updates dynamically based on config
    - Complete documentation for users copying tool to other projects
- **Files created**:
  - .prd/config.json
- **Files modified**:
  - server.js (config loading and /api/config endpoint)
  - public/app.js (fetchConfigAndUpdateUI function)
  - .prd/setup_instructions.md (comprehensive config documentation)
  - .prd/prd.json (task status and comments)
